# Installation

Put some_antidump in your resources folder, start resource and use command in console "antidump install"

After installation I recommend to obfuscate `shared.lua` file

# Commands

**antidump install** [optional > resource name]
**antidump uninstall** [optional > resource name]

# Encryption

If you want to encrypt files' data that is sended to player, you can use function `encrypt` & `decrypt` located in shared.lua
